Here is the problem statement - 
We have total 70,000 images (28 x 28), out of which 60,000 are part of train images with the label of the type of apparel (total classes: 10) and rest 10,000 images are unlabelled (known as test images).The task is to identify the type of apparel for all test images. Given below is the code description for each of the apparel class/label.
